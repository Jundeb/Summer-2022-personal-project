# Summer 2022 project

## Project name: WebBank

### Primary idea: 
Projects idea was to create web bank in which users can browse their accounts balances, transactions and transfer money to other accounts. Also users can update their personal information, reset password and create credit account. I took some ideas from our school project -bank-2022- for this project, but I used different tools and methods.

### Technologies and tools:

#### Backend
Projects backend was created with JavaScript and with the help of Node.js. Node.js has npm (a node package manager), which was very useful and I used various packages from its library. Worth mentioning libraries are Express (web application framework), Mongoose (MongoDB object modeling tool), bcrypt (a library to hash passwords), CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and JsonWebToken for user authentication.

#### Frontend
Projects frontend was created with HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) for structuring a web page, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling HTML elements and with the help of React (a JavaScript library). I chose to use React, because of its popularity and I also was interested learning the basics of it. I also used npm (a node package manager) mainly for applying and testing all kind of icons, styles and grids.

#### Database
I used MongoDB (an open-source NoSQL database) in this project mainly because I wanted to learn the basics and the difference between SQL and NoSQL database. Using MongoDB was very pleasant and interesting experience. I think it was very easy to use and I also like the simple structure of NoSQL.
